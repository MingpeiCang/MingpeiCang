	abstract = {Buckling failure is a major concern in lightweight lattice core sandwich structures (LCSSs). This study proposes an efficient method for designing LCSSs with superior buckling strength under uniaxial compression. In this approach, the buckling-resistant non-uniform shapes of single struts with different slenderness and inclination are first identified, and then they are directly used to replace uniform struts in LCSSs. This method can save considerable design time compared to conventional methods, which require conducting optimizations on entire LCSSs. Numerical results demonstrate that four designed representative non-uniform LCSSs can gain over 15\% improvement in buckling strength compared to their counterpart uniform LCSSs. This improvement is even comparable to the solutions from optimizations on entire LCSSs. Two LCSSs with non-uniform struts are 3D printed, and the test results validate at least 10\% improvement in compressive strength. Based on the proposed method, various LCSSs with superior buckling strength could be designed for different loadings.},

	abstract = {Plate lattices possess promising stiffness and yielding strength; however, their closed-cell topology dramatically increases the manufacturing difficulty. While introducing micro holes can effectively improve the manufacturability, design rationale to minimize the strength reduction induced by micro holes remain elusive. In particular, low-density plate lattices are prone to buckling failure, and design optimization for buckling strength is of great importance. Here, we propose a design method for low-density perforated plate lattices to achieve superior buckling strength using a Rayleigh quotient based theoretical criteria to determine the optimized locations of micro holes. Through linear buckling and post-buckling analysis, we demonstrate that introducing micro holes at the proposed locations can increase the critical buckling stresses and maintain the post-buckling compressive strength compared with the unperforated plate lattices. Three representative perforated plate lattices with the relative density range of 5.6\%{\textasciitilde}37.1\% were fabricated with micro laser powder bed fusion process. Compression testing results show that the proposed perforated plate lattices exhibit superior Young’s modulus and compressive strength over shell and truss lattices in the considered relative density range.},

	abstract = {Piezoelectric biomaterials, capable of converting electrical energy to mechanical energy and vice versa, are desirable for implantable devices that can achieve biosensing, tissue regeneration, anti-infection, and tumor treatment. However, their low piezoelectricity, simple geometry, and monotonous functionality remain challenging towards practical applications. Here, we report the design and additive manufacturing of a series of biocompatible piezoelectric lattice materials with bone-mimicking designs and ultrasound-regulated electrical responses. Barium calcium zirconate titanate (BCZT) with a piezoelectric coefficient d33 up to 580 pC/N was synthesized and used as the parent material of the lattices for additive manufacturing. The as-fabricated BCZT lattices have compressive strength comparable to native trabecular bones, making them promising candidates for implantation and in vivo activation. We show that the lattices allow on-demand activation of anti-tumor or osteogenic functions with programmable non-invasive ultrasound stimuli, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide new insights and a widely applicable strategy for developing versatile, non-invasive, and regulatable biomedical devices via bio-mimicking designs and additive manufacturing.},
