      text: |-
        I'm a PhD candidate in Smart Manufacturing at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I work on high-precision projection stereolithography and mechanical metamaterials under supervison of Dr. Huachen Cui and Prof. Michael Yu Wang.

        My research focuses on 
        1. enabling high resolution SLA via process optimizaiton, 
        2. developing real-time in-situ monitoring systems for SLA, and 
        3. designing high-performance lattice structures as mechanical metamaterials. 

        I'm always open to collaboration with researchers and engineers working on manufacturing science, mechanical design, or computational modeling. Please reach out to collaborate!
