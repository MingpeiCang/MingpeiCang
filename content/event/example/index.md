summary: Oral presentation in the 36th Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium
abstract: 'During projection stereolithography, the diffusion of reaction agents and Gaussian pixel radiance make it challenging to 3D print features close to the nominal optical resolution. A multi-factor model that precisely predicts the photopolymerization process in temporal and spatial domain remain elusive. Here, we developed a reaction-diffusion model involving the effects of Gaussian pixel radiance, nanoparticle scattering, and radical diffusion to predict as well as visualize the reaction with sub-pixel level spatial resolution. Based on this model, we developed a novel grayscale compensation and segmentation exposure strategy, which, for the first time, enabled the fabrication of negative features of 0.8 pixel-size and positive features of 0.2 pixel-size. We also found it possible to achieve continuous production of parts with mere baseline top-down printing system, eliminating layer artifacts without the need of oxygen permeable membrane, nonreactive fluid bed or acoustic air-volume modulation. Our method successfully fabricates assembly-free planetary gears and microchannels.'
