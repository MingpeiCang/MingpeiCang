This project focuses on analysis and optimization of thin struts and plates in lattice core sandwich panels and periodic structures (mechanical metamaterials). I use struts with freeform cross-section to construct lattice cores with 20% increase in buckling strength. I designed perforations on thin plates that can increase linear buckling strength of plate lattice structures. Those designs were verified by uniaxial compression tests of samples fabricated by powder-bed fusion.
