This project focuses on design and analysis of lightweight, open-cell plates lattice structures with high stiffness, strength, and manufacturability. Plate lattice structures outperform truss and shell lattice structures in terms of stiffness and strengh, but the closed-cell geometry greatly limits its manufacturability and application. On the other hand, the thin plates are prone to buckling failure at low relative density.

I developed a methodology to find optimal location to make cutouts on thin plates that, counterintuitively, can increase linear buckling strength of perforated plate lattice structures. The high stiffness, strength, and manufacturability of the designed plate lattice structures were verified by (1) single unit cell finite element analysis with periodic boundary condition; (2) nonlinear multi-cell finite element analysis; and (3) uniaxial compression tests of samples fabricated by laser powder-bed fusion (SS316L).
