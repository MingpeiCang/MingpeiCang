In this project, I developed a novel method to overcome the fundamental resolution limits in projection stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing, enabling the fabrication of features smaller than a single hardware pixel.

Impact: This work redefines the print capabilities of projection SLA. The technique enables the direct printing of complex, assembly-free components from both polymers and ceramics with unprecedented precision, eliminates the need for post-processing and assembly, and makes previously impossible designs (such as preassembled gearsets) achievable.
