This project focuses on analysis and optimization of thin struts in lattice core sandwich panels. Lightweight lattice cores are easy to fail by buckling due to its long slenderness ratio. I use implicit function to (1) represent struts with freeform cross-sections, and (2) construct lattice cores geometry using the struts. I used an optimization algorithm to find the best crosssection for each type of lattice core (Pyramid, BCC, BCC-Z, and six-fold lattice core), bringing more than 20% increase in linear & nonlinear buckling strength. Those designs were verified by nonlinear finite element analysis and uniaxial compression tests of samples fabricated by powder-bed fusion (PA12 fabricated by SLS).
