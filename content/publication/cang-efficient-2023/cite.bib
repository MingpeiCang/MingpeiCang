 abstract = {Buckling failure is a major concern in lightweight lattice core sandwich structures (LCSSs). This study proposes an efficient method for designing LCSSs with superior buckling strength under uniaxial compression. In this approach, the buckling-resistant non-uniform shapes of single struts with different slenderness and inclination are first identified, and then they are directly used to replace uniform struts in LCSSs. This method can save considerable design time compared to conventional methods, which require conducting optimizations on entire LCSSs. Numerical results demonstrate that four designed representative non-uniform LCSSs can gain over 15% improvement in buckling strength compared to their counterpart uniform LCSSs. This improvement is even comparable to the solutions from optimizations on entire LCSSs. Two LCSSs with non-uniform struts are 3D printed, and the test results validate at least 10% improvement in compressive strength. Based on the proposed method, various LCSSs with superior buckling strength could be designed for different loadings.},
