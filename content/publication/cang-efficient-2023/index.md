abstract: Buckling failure is a major concern in lightweight lattice core sandwich
  structures (LCSSs). This study proposes an efficient method for designing LCSSs
  with superior buckling strength under uniaxial compression. In this approach, the
  buckling-resistant non-uniform shapes of single struts with different slenderness
  and inclination are first identified, and then they are directly used to replace
  uniform struts in LCSSs. This method can save considerable design time compared
  to conventional methods, which require conducting optimizations on entire LCSSs.
  Numerical results demonstrate that four designed representative non-uniform LCSSs
  can gain over 15% improvement in buckling strength compared to their counterpart
  uniform LCSSs. This improvement is even comparable to the solutions from optimizations
  on entire LCSSs. Two LCSSs with non-uniform struts are 3D printed, and the test
  results validate at least 10% improvement in compressive strength. Based on the
  proposed method, various LCSSs with superior buckling strength could be designed
  for different loadings.
