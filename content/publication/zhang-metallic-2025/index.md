abstract: Plate lattices possess promising stiffness and yielding strength; however,
  their closed-cell topology dramatically increases the manufacturing difficulty.
  While introducing micro holes can effectively improve the manufacturability, design
  rationale to minimize the strength reduction induced by micro holes remain elusive.
  In particular, low-density plate lattices are prone to buckling failure, and design
  optimization for buckling strength is of great importance. Here, we propose a design
  method for low-density perforated plate lattices to achieve superior buckling strength
  using a Rayleigh quotient based theoretical criteria to determine the optimized
  locations of micro holes. Through linear buckling and post-buckling analysis, we
  demonstrate that introducing micro holes at the proposed locations can increase
  the critical buckling stresses and maintain the post-buckling compressive strength
  compared with the unperforated plate lattices. Three representative perforated plate
  lattices with the relative density range of 5.6%~37.1% were fabricated with micro
  laser powder bed fusion process. Compression testing results show that the proposed
  perforated plate lattices exhibit superior Youngâ€™s modulus and compressive strength
  over shell and truss lattices in the considered relative density range.
