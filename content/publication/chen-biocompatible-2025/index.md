abstract: Piezoelectric biomaterials, capable of converting electrical energy to mechanical
  energy and vice versa, are desirable for implantable devices that can achieve biosensing,
  tissue regeneration, anti-infection, and tumor treatment. However, their low piezoelectricity,
  simple geometry, and monotonous functionality remain challenging towards practical
  applications. Here, we report the design and additive manufacturing of a series
  of biocompatible piezoelectric lattice materials with bone-mimicking designs and
  ultrasound-regulated electrical responses. Barium calcium zirconate titanate (BCZT)
  with a piezoelectric coefficient d33 up to 580 pC/N was synthesized and used as
  the parent material of the lattices for additive manufacturing. The as-fabricated
  BCZT lattices have compressive strength comparable to native trabecular bones, making
  them promising candidates for implantation and in vivo activation. We show that
  the lattices allow on-demand activation of anti-tumor or osteogenic functions with
  programmable non-invasive ultrasound stimuli, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings
  provide new insights and a widely applicable strategy for developing versatile,
  non-invasive, and regulatable biomedical devices via bio-mimicking designs and additive
  manufacturing.
